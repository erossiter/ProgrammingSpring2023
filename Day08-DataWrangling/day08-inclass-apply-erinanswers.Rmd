Write the R code to answer the following questions. You have until the beginning of next class to answer all of the questions below and commit to GitHub.



# Question 1

Use an apply function instead of a for loop to create a vector containing the following elements: "num1", "num2", ... "num100"

```{r}
out_vec <- sapply(1:100, function(x) paste0("num", x))
out_vec

# equivalent
unlist(lapply(1:100, function(x) paste0("num", x)))

sapply(1:100, paste0, "num")
```



# Question 2

Use a function in the "apply" family to find the fastest stopping speed for each group of cars, where the cars are grouped by their stopping distance
```{r}
data(cars)
tapply(cars$speed, cars$dist, min)
```

# Question 3

Using an apply function, find the means for each column in the `cars` dataset.

```{r}
apply(cars, 2, mean)
```
